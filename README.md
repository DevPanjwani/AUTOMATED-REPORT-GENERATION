##This repository presents a Python-based implementation created as part of Task-2 of the CODTECH Internship program, focusing on automated report generation through data analysis and document creation. The project demonstrates how structured data can be read from an external file, processed programmatically, and transformed into a professionally formatted report. Using the Pandas library, the script loads data from a CSV file and performs analytical operations such as calculating averages, identifying maximum and minimum values, and organizing the dataset into meaningful summaries. These computed insights are then passed to the FPDF library, which is used to construct a well-structured PDF document containing titles, formatted text, and organized content. The overall workflow highlights the integration of file handling, data processing, and output automation in Python, emphasizing practical development skills relevant to real-world scenarios where reports must be generated efficiently and consistently. This project also reflects fundamental programming practices including modular code structure, readability, and the use of external libraries to extend functionality. By automating the transition from raw data to shareable documentation, the implementation demonstrates an understanding of how software solutions can reduce manual effort and improve productivity in data-driven environments. The repository includes the source code, input dataset, and generated report output, providing a complete example of how Python can be applied to build scalable and reproducible reporting tools suitable for academic, business, or technical applications.
